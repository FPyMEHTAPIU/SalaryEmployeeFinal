# SalaryEmployeeFinal

In this project, I implemented the ability to store, add, and retrieve employee information from a file. Each employee has:

- a unique identifier (id)
- a name
- a salary type: monthly, hourly, or commission-based
- a salary amount

In the case of hourly and commission-based payments, the file stores the entered hourly rate/salary, but the total amount is displayed when outputted on the screen.

It's not possible to add an employee with the same name to the file!

During the programming process, inheritance, file handling, lambda functions, working with class objects, functions, and STL library containers were actively utilized.
